# Alembic Migration Management

## Creating an Alembic Migration

To create an Alembic Migration for changes to the database tables use the below command:

```bash
alembic revision -m "create account table"
```

## Running an Alembic Migration

To apply an Alembic migration and upgrade your database schema to a specific revision, use the following command:

```bash
alembic upgrade [revision_ID] or [HEAD]
```

## Reverting an Alembic Migration

If you need to remove or revert an Alembic migration, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Downgrade the Database

To revert the most recent migration, use:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

If you need to revert multiple migrations or downgrade to a specific earlier revision, specify the target revision ID or use a relative number to indicate how many migrations to revert:

```bash
alembic downgrade [target_revision_ID]
```

or

```bash
alembic downgrade -[number_of_steps]
```

### Step 2: Delete the Migration Script (Development Only)

After downgrading, you can optionally delete the migration script file if it is no longer needed:

```bash
# Manually navigate to your migrations/versions directory and delete the unwanted script.
rm [filename_of_the_migration_script]
```

**Note**: This step should be performed only in a development environment. Do not delete migration scripts that have been applied in other development environments, shared with your team, or deployed to production.
