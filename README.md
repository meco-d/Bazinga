## Project Overview

EVolution aims to revolutionize the EV charging infrastructure by providing:

- A user-friendly interface for EV owners, station operators, and maintenance teams.
- Real-time updates on charger status (online, offline, reserved) and energy usage insights.
- Dynamic pricing and AI-driven charging optimization features.
- A detailed charging station map with real-time updates, search, and filtering functionalities.
- Robust security measures to protect user data.
- Community engagement and gamification features to promote eco-friendly driving practices.

## Features

### Intuitive User Experience (UX) Design
- User-friendly interface catering to various stakeholders.
- Emphasis on usability and accessibility.

### Real-time Monitoring & Analytics
- Dashboard providing live updates on charger status and energy usage.

### Next-generation Smart Charging Features
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Charging prices vary based on demand, time of day, or energy availability.
- **AI-Driven Charging Optimization**: AI analyzes data to optimize charging schedules.

### Charging Station Map Development
- Real-time updates on station availability, status, and location.
- Search and filtering functionalities for enhanced user experience.

### Security & Privacy
- Encryption and authentication protocols to safeguard user data.
- Compliance with privacy regulations.

### Community & Gamification
- Forums, leaderboards, and challenges to foster community engagement.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evolution.git
   cd evolution
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## API Endpoints

The project includes several API endpoints for interacting with the charging station data. Below are some of the key endpoints:

- **GET /api/stations**: Retrieve a list of all charging stations.
- **GET /api/stations/:id**: Retrieve details of a specific charging station.
- **POST /api/stations**: Add a new charging station.
- **PUT /api/stations/:id**: Update an existing charging station.
- **DELETE /api/stations/:id**: Delete a charging station.
